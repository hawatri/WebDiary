# HAWATRI WEB DIARY

Welcome to my personal web diary repository. This digital space contains my thoughts, projects, and explorations in web development and beyond. Here you'll find various HTML pages documenting my journey through different technical topics and personal reflections.

The diary is organized as a static website with an index page that serves as a table of contents, linking to individual entries stored in the pages directory. Each entry represents a snapshot of my learning or a project I'm working on.

Feel free to browse through my entries and explore the content I've created.
